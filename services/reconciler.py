Reconciler - Exchange Truth to Position Conversion

Separates IO (fetching trades from exchange) from logic (position updates).
Ensures positions always reflect exchange reality.

Responsibilities:
- Fetch trades for completed orders from exchange
- Pass trades to Portfolio for position reconciliation
- Log all reconciliation events for audit trail

NOT Responsible For:
- Trading decisions (handled by Decision layer)
- Order placement (handled by OrderRouter)
- Position lifecycle management (handled by Portfolio)
